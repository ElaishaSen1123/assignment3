      <p>The International Programs & Collaborations Office at OCAD University presents <strong>International Lecture Series: Beyond Bias</strong>. This international lecture series brings together academics and researchers from around the world to share their experiences, methodologies, and scholarly approaches to fostering inclusive collaborations across borders. Focusing on the intersection of global education and creative research, the series aims to provide valuable insights on how to collaborate effectively with students and professors from diverse cultural backgrounds.</p>

      <p><em>Beyond Bias Banner</em></p>

      <p>Each lecture will feature expert speakers who will share their personal journeys, research strategies, and academic examples of successful international collaborations. Emphasizing cultural awareness, the series will explore how to navigate biases, promote equity, equality, and social justice, and go beyond preconceptions to build a more inclusive and respectful global creative community.</p>

      <p>This series invites participants to reflect on their own cultural assumptions and gain tools to engage with international colleagues and students in a meaningful, ethical, and thoughtful way. By challenging misconceptions and fostering mutual understanding, we aim to create collaborations that are both globally relevant and locally responsive.</p>
